      "Sarah Chen's board prep session on Feb 10 at 2:00 PM has been rescheduled to 4:00 PM to accommodate the Acme Corp call. However, the 4:00 PM slot now conflicts with a mandatory timesheet review and approval session that Finance scheduled as a 'mandatory same-day' meeting. The timesheet review involves end-of-month compliance sign-offs and cannot be delegated or moved without Finance approval. AdminBuddy cannot resolve this autonomously because both meetings are flagged as unmovable — one by client priority rules and the other by Finance policy.",
